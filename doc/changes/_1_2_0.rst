Version 1.2 - 06/05/2022
------------------------

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

- New ``benchopt info`` command to display information about solvers and datasets
  of a benchmark, by `Ghislain Durif`_ (:gh:`140`).

- New ``--profile`` option to the ``run`` command in order to profile
  with the line-profiler package all functions decorated with
  :func:`benchopt.utils.profile`, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`186`).

- Replace ``SufficientDescentCriterion`` by ``SufficientProgressCriterion``,
  which measures progress relative to the best attained value instead of
  the previous one, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`176`)

- Now all values returned by ``Objective.compute`` are included in reports,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`200`).

- New ``--n-jobs, -j`` option to run the benchmark in parallel with
  ``joblib``, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`265`).

API
~~~

- When returning a dictionary, ``Objective.compute`` should at least include
  ``value`` key instead of ``objective_value``, by `Thomas Moreau`_ and
  `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`200`).

- ``stop_strategy`` attribute is replaced by ``stopping_strategy`` to harmonize
  with ``stopping_criterion``, by `Benoît Malézieux`_ (:gh:`274`).

- Add ``import_from`` method in ``safe_import_context`` to allow importing common
  files and packages without installation from `BENCHMARK_DIR/utils`,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`286`).

- Add ``X_density`` argument to ``datasets.make_correlated_data`` to simulate
  sparse design matrices, by `Mathurin Massias`_ (:gh:`289`).

- ``Dataset.get_data`` should now return a dictionary and not a tuple. A point for
  testing  should be returned by a dedicated method
  ``Objective.get_one_solution``, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`345`).

CLI
~~~

- Replace ``-p`` flag by ``-o`` for Objective, by `Mathurin Massias`_ (:gh:`281`).

- Add ``--config`` option to support passing argument with a ``yaml``
  config file, by `Mathurin Massias`_ (:gh:`325`).
