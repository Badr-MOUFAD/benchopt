Version 1.1 - 22-04-2021
------------------------

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

- New plotting functions with different optimality criteria,
  by `Nidham Gazagnadou`_ (:gh:`96`).

- Support Plotly for plotting functions, by `Thomas Moreau`_,
  `Tanguy Lefort`_ and `Joseph Salmon`_ (:gh:`110`, :gh:`111`, :gh:`112`).

- Change envrionment variable for config from ``BENCHO_*`` to ``BENCHOPT_*``,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`128`).

- Add autocompletion support in the ``benchopt`` command,
  by `Alexandre Gramfort`_, `Tanguy Lefort`_ and `Thomas Moreau`_
  (:gh:`133`, :gh:`135`).

- Move most CI to GitHub action, with auto-release on PyPi,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`150`, :gh:`154`).

- Remove ``BENCHOPT_ALLOW_INSTALL`` and always install to requested env as
  the user now must request explicitly the install,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`155`).

API
~~~

- ``Objective.compute`` can now return a dictionary with multiple outputs to
  monitor several metrics at once, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`84`).

- ``Solver.skip`` can now be used to skip objectives that are incompatible
  for the Solver, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`113`).

- ``Solver`` can now use ``stop_strategy='callback'`` to allow for
  single call curve construction, by `Tanguy Lefort`_ and `Thomas Moreau`_
  (:gh:`137`).

- Add ``StoppingCriterion`` to reliably and flexibly assess a solver convergence (cvg).
  For now, only ``SufficientDescentCriterion`` is implemented but better
  API to set criterion per benchmark should be implemented in a future release,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`151`)

CLI
~~~

- Add ``--version`` option for ``benchopt``, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`83`).

- Add ``--pdb`` option for ``benchopt run`` to open debugger on error and help
  benchmark debugging, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`86`).

- Change default run to local mode. Can call a run in a dedicated env with
  option ``--env`` or ``--env-name ENV_NAME`` to specify the env,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`94`).

- Add ``benchopt publish`` command to push benchmark results to GitHub,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`110`).

- Add ``benchopt clean`` command to remove cached files and output files locally,
  by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`128`).

- Add ``benchopt config`` command to allow easy configuration of ``benchopt``
  using the CLI, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`128`).

- Add ``benchopt install`` command to install benchmark requirements
  (not done in ``benchopt run`` anymore) by `Ghislain Durif`_ (:gh:`135`).

- Add ``benchopt info`` command to print information about a benchmark
  (including solvers, datasets, dependencies, etc.)
  by `Ghislain Durif`_ (:gh:`140`).


BUG
~~~

- Throw a warning when benchopt version in conda env does not match the one of
  calling ``benchopt``, by `Thomas Moreau`_ (:gh:`83`).

- Fix Lapack issue with R code, by `Tanguy Lefort`_ (:gh:`97`).


DOC
~~~

- Improve how-to narrative documentation, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`93`).

- Add what's new page, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`114`).

- Add documentation on how to publish results, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ (:gh:`118`).
