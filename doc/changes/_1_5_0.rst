-----------------

API
~~~

- ``Solver.support_sparse`` attribute is deprecated in favor of the use of
``Solver.skip``, by `Mathurin Massias`_ (:gh:`614`).

- ``stopping_strategy`` attribute is replaced by ``sampling_strategy`` to clarify
  the concept, by `Mathurin Massias`_ (:gh:`585`).

- Add ``Solver.warm_up`` function for explicit warmup instructions, such as
  empty run for jitting. This function is called only once per solver.
