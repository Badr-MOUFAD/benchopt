Visualize benchmark
===================

After running a benchmark, benchopt build automatically a dashboard
to display the output of the benchmark. The dashboard is in ``HTML`` format
so that it can be easily shared.

Let's explore the dashboard features on Benchmark Lasso.
Beforehand, make sure that benchopt is well installed
and the Lasso benchmark is well set up by following the :ref:`get_started`.
